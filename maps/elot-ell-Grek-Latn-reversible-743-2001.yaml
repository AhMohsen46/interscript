  Reversible transliteration standard, ELOT

note:
  - Transliteration standard (reversible): Clause 3.1, Table 1
  - Assuming that ou, au, eu transliterations are only intended for historical diphthongs /u, av, ev/, and that όυ, άυ, έυ are not to be transliterated as ou, au, eu
  - Introduced casing to digamma and lunate sigma. (Casing was late introduction to character sets for those characters)
