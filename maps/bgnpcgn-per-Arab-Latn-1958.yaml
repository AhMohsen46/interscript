  The BGN/PCGN 1958 System for the Persian alphabet was
  adopted by the BGN in 1946 and by the PCGN In 1958. It Is
  used for the romanization of standard geographic names in
  Iran.
  The Persian alphabet is the same as the Arabic alphabet
  except for the addition of four consonant symbols for
  sounds which do not occur in Arabic. Therefore, the same
  conversion values are used for the Persian alphabet as for
  the Arabic alphabet wherever phonetically valid. Where
  letters common to the two alphabets have different
  pronunciation in the two languages, conversion values
  reflecting the Persian pronunciation are provided in the
  Persian system.
  It may be noted that neither the system of pointing nor the
  conversion values for vowels and diphthongs are the same
  for Persian as for Arabic.
  Persian presents the same problems of vowel pointing as
  Arabic in that the short vowel symbols necessary for the
  proper rendering of short vowels, long vowels, and
  diphthongs are almost always omitted from written Persian.
  It follows that, in order to produce transliter- tions in
  terms of standard written Persian, the transliterator must
  be able to identify the words used in names and must know
  their standard written Persian spelling, their proper vowel
  pointing, and how to eliminate pecularities due to
  dialectical variation.
  The notes and special rules explain details of
  transliteration not stated in the tables.

notes:
  - |
    1)The Persian writing system, in its generally used form,
    employs only the symbols found in Table I, and the alef maddeh
    (آ) of Table II. The symbols in column 1 of Table II are
    traditional auxiliary symbols used by Persians only
    sporadically to indicate the exact reading of a given word.
    In the case of i, ū, ey and ow, a choice of symbology
    exists, one system adhering to the Arabic tradition, the
    other being a modification of it. Likewise, there are two
    ways of writing alef maq§ureh. The BGN/PCGN transliteration
    system presupposes forms fully pointed with the Persian
    symbols represented in Table II, though these are omitted
    from the examples given below.

  - 2) Alef ( أ ) occurs with the following uses
    a. Initially, it indicates that the word begins with a vowel or
    diphthong, and the alef itself is not transliterated, e.g.,
    انجيرة Anjīreh, ايواني Eyvānī
    b. Initially with maddeh ( آ ),it indicates ā, e.g., آبادان Ābādān.
    c. Medially and finally. it represents ā, e.g., e.g., آبادان Ābādān,
     توكا Tūkā.
    d.	With hamzeh. See Note 5.


  - 3) Where special considerations are paramount, the sub-dot
    may be used in place of the cedilla

  - 4) The two-letter symbols kh, zh, sh, and gh are convenient
    for use and easily comprehensible. The infrequent sequences
    of kāf, ze, sīn, and gāf followed by he can be unequivocally
    transliterated for bibliographical purposes by the use of a
    slant line (“shilling,” “solidus") to separate true h from
    a preceding k, z, s, or	g; that is,	kh represents khe, but
    k/h stands for kāf followed by he.

  - 5) Hamzeh (ء)	is	not regarded as a letter of the Persian
    alphabet, but as a diacritic mark, and as such is not
    always expressed in actual writing. In fully pointed words,
    however, it appears in several graphic forms, standing
    alone or written in conjunction with alef, vav, or ye (the
    ye in this instance being undotted). All these forms are
    transliterated simply with the apostrophe in the form
    resembling a small raised figure 9 (’)	,e.g., جزء Joz’
    صفراء şafrā’, مأخذ ma’khaz̄, مؤتمن mu’taman, پائين pā’īn Occasionally a word may
    appear pointed according to the strict Arabic tradition so
    as to indicate an initial hamzeh. This initial hamzeh is
    never transliterated, but only the vowel which it carries,
    e.g., •Jfi , whether pointed	or	0	.	is "transliterated
    simply Anjireh.	' Hamzeh is also sometimes written over
    final he or ye to represent the -ye form of the eg&feh, cf.
    Note 8.

  - 6) Alef maddeh is used initially to indicate ā, e.g., آبادان Ābādān
    Noninitially it indicates ’ā in words of Arabic origin,
    and must be so transliterated, e.g., قرآن Qor’ān, مآب ma’āb

  - 7) Tashdid ( ّ) indicates doubling of the consonant over which
    it is written and is represented in transliteration by writing
    the consonant twice, e.g محمّد Mohammad The sequence kasreh ye ye
    is transliterated īy.In names of Arabic origin containing the
    definite article, the vowel of the article is transliterated according
    to its Persian pronunciation and the lam, when followed by a “sun letter”
    (t, s̄, d, z̄, r, s, sh, ẕ, ţ, z̧, ţ, z̧, l, n) is assimilated. The article
    is written in lower case and separate from the preceding and following word,
    e.g., Zeyn od Din, but *£4 . Zeyn ed Dīn. Cf. Special Rule 1.

  - 8) The relational suffix	is	transliter ated -e after final consonants
    (except for silent A). After silent A and after vowels, it is transliterated
    -ye. It is usually not expressed in Persian writing after a consonant^/
    (kasreh being understood), e.g., Kuh-e MarghQb. After final alef	it
    is written with ye (tf), e.g.,	P&-ye Ab,	As.	After	ye	(<5)	and
    silent he it is written as hamzeh over the letter, e.g.,	//**{) Dah&neh-ye Mambar,
    Salasl-ye Soz^rg. Digitized by boogie

  - The word الله, meaning God, should always be romanized Allāh,
    except as specified in note 3. Note that the Unicode value FDF2 spells
    Allāh, but omits the alif in some common fonts, including Times New
    Roman. If in doubt, try in Arial Unicode MS to verify. Also note that
    the “dagger al f” ( ) above the second ل (lām) n the ord الله, is not
    written but should be romanized ā, like a full-size alif.

  - In names of Arabic origin, the l of the definite article al s ass m
    lated before the ‘s n letters’ , , , , r, z, s, sh, ş, ẕ, , z, l and n.
    In its romanization, the article should be separated from the name it
    precedes and should not be capitalized except at the beginning of a
    name, e.g. جبل السراج→ Jabal
    as Sarāj

  - In Arabic names, a shaddah, ّ is used to denote the doubling of a
    particular consonant character, e.g. ُم َح َمد → Muḩammad. Ho ever, n
    Pashto th s ‘do bl ng’ s freq ently om tted n both Perso- Arabic script
    and the resulting romanization. Guidance on doubling may be taken from
    an authoritative names source, such as an Afghan government source or
    Pashto dictionary; for example, it is usual to see Ḩājī without and
    ‘Abbās with the doubled consonant. The doubled y consonant is almost
    always retained, as in Sayyid or Qayyūm.

  - In Afghan names which contain an iẕāfah, it should be romanized as
    -e or –ye according to
    common pronunciation, but generally, -e is used if the preceding word
    ends with a consonant other
    than silent heh, and -ye if the preceding word ends with a vowel
    sound e.g. غر ِحصار → Ghar-e ِ
    Ḩ şār; َقل َع ٔه َنو → Qal‘ah-ye Now. Scholarly sources indicate that
    heh is silent in darah and qal‘ah (thus darah-ye, qal‘ah-ye), but
    lightly spoken in kōh and chāh (thus kōh-e, chāh-e).

  - The character sequence خو, where followed by ا or ی should be
    romanized khwā or khwī, although the w is either not pronounced, or
    only weakly so, as in خواجه → khwājah.

  - Plural nouns ending in -hā or -ān should always be romanized as a
    single word, regardless of whether a space appears in a Perso-Arabic
    script source.

  - Unicode values listed in the tables above are required to ensure
    standardization and to minimize confusion from competing
    representations of a given character. It should be noted that the
    Persian Unicode value 0643 or FEDA( ك Unicode value 06A9) is
    recommended rather than the Arabic( ک or FED9), the Persian گ (Unicode
    value 06AF) is recommended rather than ګ (Unicode value 06AB) or ڰ
    (Unicode value 06B0) or ك (Unicode value 0643 or FEDA or FED9), and the
    Pashto character ځ (Unicode value 0681) is recommended rather than the
    heh with a dot above and a dot below (no Unicode value). For the letter ی
    in its many variations, care must be exercised to follow this romanization
    guide's recommendations to eliminate confusion for search engines
    and software. BGN/PCGN does not use the Unicode encoding FEEF for the
    character ی in any Afghan word.
