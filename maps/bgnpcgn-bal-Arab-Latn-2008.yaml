    The following is the BGN/PCGN-approved romanization 
    system for deriving standard spellings of Baluchi 
    geographic names. The romanization system is based on 
    the Hunterian system of romanization, which has been 
    used by the Surveys of India and Pakistan for 
    romanizing Baluchi geographic names for more than one 
    hundred years. The romanization system is compatible 
    with all dialects of Baluchi, including Eastern 
    Baluchi, Western Baluchi, and Southern Baluchi.
    
    The BGN/PCGN system laid out below includes diacritical
    marks in order that the original script can be derived 
    from the romanized form (i.e. it is reversible). For 
    desk users requiring a diacritic-free form, these 
    diacritics can simply be removed. In almost every case 
    the same basic Roman-script characters are kept as are 
    used in the Hunterian system. The BGN/PCGN forms have 
    further been designed to harmonize with the BGN/PCGN 
    Urdu romanization system. In rigorous romanization 
    (i.e. including diacritics), retroflexion is marked by 
    a sub-dot, and aspiration is marked by an apostrophe, 
    where confusion with fricative digraphs could arise. 
    For letters used only in Arabic loan words, the 
    rigorous forms have further been designed to harmonize 
    with the BGN/PCGN Persian romanization system.
    
notes:
- Occasionally, sequences of /z/ or /s/ plus /h/ may be 
encountered, i.e. z·h, s·h. These may be romanized with the 
Unicode 'center dot' (U+00B7) separating the two letters, 
to distinguish them from the digraphs /zh/ and /sh/.

- The character ة is found very rarely in Baluchi, principally in certain Arabic religious terms, e.g. zakāt
('alms'). It should be romanized t.

- When the letters ال are found, representing the Arabic 
definite article, the ل is assimilated to a following 'sun letter' ,د ,ث ,ت
ل ,ظ ,ط , ض , ,ص ,ش ,س , ,ر ,ذ or ن and is romanized t, , d, , r, z, s, sh, ş, ẕ ţ z , l, n accordingly.

- In romanization, the suffixes ءَ (-ā, singular definite) 
and ءِ (-ay, possessive) are connected to the previous word 
by a hyphen, though they are usually written separately.

- The word for 'and', written as و or ءُ, should be 
romanized as –u-, linked by hyphens to the two words it 
connects; e.g.,
ہ ٹد و س ٹد → Sind-u-Hind ('The Gangetic Plain').

- Except as specified in notes 4 and 5, word division in romanization should follow word division in the Baluchi script.

- Note that the short vowels in the Baluchi examples are not pointed.

- Certain initial, medial and final characters are not 
readily available in a Unicode-encoded font in a standalone form.

- The Romanization columns show only lowercase forms but, 
when romanizing, uppercase and lowercase Roman letters as 
appropriate should be used.
